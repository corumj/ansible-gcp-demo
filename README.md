# Ansible GCP Demo

This demo will kickoff the discussion about Ansible Integration


### Requirements
You need a Google Cloud Account with billing setup.
A Project setup for OS Login
A Service Account (these instruction were handy: [How to configure OS Login in GCP for Ansible](https://alex.dzyoba.com/blog/gcp-ansible-service-account/))
Some other stuff I'm probably forgetting, good luck.
