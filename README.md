# Ansible GCP Demo

This demo will kickoff the discussion about Ansible Integration


### Requirements
You need a Google Cloud Account with billing setup.

A Project setup for OS Login

A Service Account (these instruction were handy: [How to configure OS Login in GCP for Ansible](https://alex.dzyoba.com/blog/gcp-ansible-service-account/))

Also good to follow the steps to setup the GCP Dynamic Inventory plugin [Ansible Google Cloud Platform Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_gce.html)

Some other stuff I'm probably forgetting, good luck.
